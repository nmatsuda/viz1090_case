This is a 3D printable case for the [Pimoroni Hyperpixel4 Square](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/hyperpixel-4-square?variant=30138251444307) Raspberry Pi display.

I made this for [viz1090](https://github.com/nmatsuda/viz1090), but the only non-standard thing about the setup is I've sized it for a Pi with the USB and Ethernet ports snipped off, which makes the stack about half as tall. Hopefully someone makes a CM4 compatible display like this eventually.

There are pockets on the back for a [60mm x 10mm x 3mm bar magnet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DFZH4WT), which you'll have to glue in (I tried making little retaining tabs but they kept breaking off... those magnets are strong).

This repo includes the original Blender file and a print-ready STL (units: mm). I tightened up the tolerances by trial and error so you may need to adjust depending on the characteristics of your particular printer.
