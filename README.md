This is a 3D printable case for the [Pimoroni Hyperpixel4 Square](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/hyperpixel-4-square?variant=30138251444307) display and a Raspberry Pi 4 with the USB and Ethernet jacks snipped off. Hopefully someone makes a CM4 compatible display like this, but using some wire cutters to cut off the ports is pretty easy and makes the stack about half as tall.

There are pockets on the back for a [60mm x 10mm x 3mm bar magnet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DFZH4WT), which you'll have to glue in (I tried making little retaining tabs but they kept breaking off... those magnets are strong).

This repo includes the original Blender file and a print-ready STL (units: mm). I tightened up the tolerances by trial and error so you may need to adjust depending on the characteristics of your particular printer.
